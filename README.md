# Budget Tracker Starter Code by Russell Morgan

## Description
This weeks challenge was to make a Budget Tracker application a Progressive Web Application. We added the IndexedDB tool, a server worker and a manifest.json file. After all coding was finished the application was deployed using Heroku with mLab.

The application allows the user to keep track of their budget balance online or offline. The users enters a transaction, the title and amount, the balance is re-calculated. If offline the balance is still calculated, the transaction is saved to the IndexedDB database until the browser goes back online.
